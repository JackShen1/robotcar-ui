# RobotCar UI

<h3 align="center">The concept of UI for Robot Car Control</h3> 

This project were designed with the help of Angular framework, because it has the capabilities to create enough progressive graphical interface and animation.

This page can display a map of the room with the location of the car, its speed and distance traveled (no really, it's just a design), and also has the appropriate indicators. It is possible to change the size of the room map and add a border to the map (for a better view).
